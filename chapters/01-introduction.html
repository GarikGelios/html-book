    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>A Guide to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge® (BABOK® Guide) is the globally recognized standard for the
      practice of business analysis. The BABOK® Guide describes business analysis knowledge areas, tasks, underlying
      competencies, techniques and perspectives on how to approach business analysis.</p>
    <h3 id="purpose-of-the-babok-guide">Purpose of the BABOK® Guide</h3>
    <p>The primary purpose of the BABOK® Guide is to define the profession of business analysis and provide a set of
      commonly accepted practices. It helps practitioners discuss and define the skills necessary to effectively perform
      business analysis work. The BABOK® Guide also helps people who work with and employ business analysts to
      understand the skills and knowledge they should expect from a skilled practitioner.</p>
    <p>Business analysis is a broad profession in which business analysts might perform work for many different types of
      initiatives across an enterprise. Practitioners may employ different competencies, knowledge, skills, terminology,
      and attitudes that they use when performing business analysis tasks. The common framework for all perspectives,
      describing business analysis tasks that are performed to properly analyze a change or evaluate the necessity for a
      change. Tasks may vary in form, order, or importance for individual business analysts or for various initiatives.
    </p>
    <p>The six knowledge areas of the BABOK® Guide (Business Analysis Planning and Monitoring, Elicitation and
      Collaboration, Requirements Life Cycle Management, Strategy Analysis, Requirements Analysis and Design Definition
      (RADD), and Solution Evaluation) describe the practice of business analysis as it is applied within the boundaries
      of a project or throughout enterprise evolution and continuous improvement. The following image shows how three of
      the knowledge areas support the delivery of business value before, during, and after the life cycle of a project.

    <h3 id="what-is-business-analysis">What is Business Analysis?</h3>
    <p>Business analysis is the practice of enabling change in an enterprise by defining needs and recommending
      solutions that deliver value to stakeholders. Business analysis enables an enterprise to articulate needs and the
      rationale for change, and to design and describe solutions that can deliver value.</p>
    <p>Business analysis is performed on a variety of initiatives within an enterprise. Initiatives may be strategic,
      tactical, or operational. Business analysis may be performed within the boundaries of a project or throughout
      enterprise evolution and continuous improvement. It can be used to understand the current state, to define the
      future state, and to determine the activities required to move from the current to the future state.</p>
    <p>Business analysis can be performed from a diverse array of perspectives. The
      BABOK® Guide describes several of these perspectives: agile, business
      intelligence, information technology, business architecture, and business process management. A perspective can be
      thought of as a lens through which the business analysis practitioner views their work activities based on the
      current context. One or many perspectives may apply to an initiative, and the perspectives outlined in the BABOK®
      Guide do not represent all the contexts for business analysis or the complete set of business analysis
      disciplines.</p>
    <h3 id="who-is-a-business-analyst">Who is a Business Analyst?</h3>
    <p>A business analyst is any person who performs business analysis tasks described in the BABOK® Guide, no matter
      their job title or organizational role. Business analysts are responsible for discovering, synthesizing, and
      analyzing information from a variety of sources within an enterprise, including tools, processes, documentation,
      and stakeholders. The business analyst is responsible for eliciting the actual needs of stakeholders—which
      frequently involves investigating and clarifying their expressed desires—in order to determine underlying issues
      and causes.</p>
    <p>Business analysts play a role in aligning the designed and delivered solutions with the needs of stakeholders.
      The activities that business analysts perform include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>understanding enterprise problems and goals,</li>
      <li>analyzing needs and solutions,</li>
      <li>devising strategies,</li>
      <li>driving change, and</li>
      <li>facilitating stakeholder collaboration.</li>
    </ul>

      activities that accomplish the purpose of their associated knowledge area.</p>
